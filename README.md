KarateChop Solution
This solution provides a binary search implementation (KarateChop class) and demonstrates its usage through a console application and an API. It also includes unit tests for validating the functionality.

Projects
1. KarateChopDomain
The KarateChopDomain project contains the core logic of the binary search implementation.

Files:
KarateChop.cs: Implements the KarateChop class with the binary search method.
karate_icon.png: A placeholder image file.
2. KarateChopApp
The KarateChopApp project is a console application that demonstrates the usage of the KarateChop class.

Files:
Program.cs: Contains the main method demonstrating the binary search on a sample array.
3. KarateChopApi
The KarateChopApi project is a minimal API that exposes the KarateChop class functionality via a RESTful API.

Files:
Program.cs: Sets up the API endpoints and handles HTTP requests.
appsettings.json: Configuration file for the API.
Dockerfile: Instructions for building a Docker image for the API.
.dockerignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Docker.
4. KarateChopDomain.Tests
The KarateChopDomain.Tests project contains unit tests for the KarateChop class.

Files:
GlobalUsings.cs: Contains global using directives for the test project.
KarateChopTests.cs: Implements unit tests for the KarateChop class
